## Initial proposal
For my interface I will be using my collaborative game which is a top down point and click horror game. In the game you are a "god character" who is controlling a person in a dark library, I think this would work well in AR as the main way to control the character is by clicking, so in AR you would just tap where you are looking to move the character. As the game is top down it could played on the floor or even a table which I think would work really well. As a stretch goal, rather than it just being like a screen on a table, I will make the game world 3d so it would look like the library is actually there on the table or on the floor.

## Capsule Apocalypse
Capsule Apocalypse is an endless wave based survival shooter. You control a lone survivor who is trying to survive by fighting off the evil purple capsules. The world is wherever the user is playing the game as it maps out your surroundings, at the start of the game you place the character in the real world.

## Instructions
* Look around your environment until it has all been mapped before placing the player.
* When you have mapped your play area tap to place the player on a flat surface.
* KILL THE ENEMIES & SURVIVE!

Tap - Shoot / Place enemy to start game
#### Tip: #### 
To tap hold arm out in front of you, point your index finger straight up and pivot it down towards your thumb, WITHOUT bending your finger.
#### PRO tip: #####
Use two hands for rapid fire :D

#### Voice Controls: ####
